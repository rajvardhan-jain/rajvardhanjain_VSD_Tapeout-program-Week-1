# ▸ Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and sysnthesis

## L1: Introduction to iverilog Design and Testbench

### ▸Simulator:

- RTL design is checked for adherence to the specifications by simulating the design.
- Simulator is the tool used for simulating the design, e.g iverilog.

### ▸Design:

- Design is the actual verilog code or set of verilog codes which has intended functionality to meet with the required specifications.

### ▸Testbench:

- Testbench is the setup to apply stimulus (test_vectors) to the design to check its functionality.

### How simulator works?

- Simulator looks for the changes on the input signals.
- Upon change to the input, the output is evaluated,
  i.e if no change to the input, no change to the output.
- Simulator is looking for change in the values of input.
